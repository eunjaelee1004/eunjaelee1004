## Hi, I'm Eunjae. 👋

I am an aspiring economist who seeks to apply artificial intelligence and data analytics to address problems in the social sciences.

With the long-term goal of modeling complex real-world phenomena through computational methods, I continuously engage in projects of varying scale to refine my analytical and technical skills. Through these experiences, I aim to develop the ability to rigorously analyze social issues and generate meaningful, data-driven solutions.
